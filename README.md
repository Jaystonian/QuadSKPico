# **README - QuadSKPico (Open-Source SID Emulation Hardware)**

## **About This Project**

QuadSKpico is an open-source hardware design for a **multi-RP2040-based SID chip emulator**. It is built from the ground up, independent of SIDKick, and aims to provide a **fully open alternative** for C64 audio enthusiasts.

## **Why This Project?**

- **Truly open-source**: Unlike other designs, all schematics and PCB layouts are **fully published**.
- **Expandable & Community-Driven**: Encourages modifications, improvements, and innovations.
- **No artificial restrictions**: Anyone can build, improve, and even sell hardware based on this design.

## **License & Usage**

- This hardware is licensed under the **CERN OHL-S 2.0**, ensuring it remains open and free.
- The firmware it runs is released under **GPLv3**, meaning modifications must also remain open-source.
- This project is **not affiliated with or derived from SIDKick hardware** and the SIDKick Pico software is not compatible.

## **How to Contribute**

Pull requests, hardware modifications, and software contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork, improve, and share your work.

## **Credits**

- Hardware Designed by **JAYSTONIAN**
- Inspired by the open-source hardware movement and the SID emulation community.
